## 🚀 How to Test

### Super Quick (5 minutes):

```bash
cd ~/demo_app
./setup.sh                          # Install everything
python3 test_claw_overlay.py        # See the claw!
python3 src/app.py                  # Run Voice Mode
# Hold Caps Lock → Speak → Release → Paste!
```

### With Guidance:
- See **QUICKSTART.md** for step-by-step instructions
- See **TESTING.md** for comprehensive testing guide

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

1. **Voice Recording**
   - Hold Caps Lock to record
   - Real-time visual feedback
   - Waveform shows audio levels
   - Timer shows recording duration

2. **Speech Transcription**
   - Uses OpenAI Whisper (local, offline)
   - Multiple model sizes (tiny → large-v3)
   - Auto-detects language
   - Accurate (90-95% for clear speech)
   - Fast (~2 seconds for 3-second audio)

3. **Output**
   - Automatically copies to clipboard
   - macOS notification with transcribed text
   - Ready to paste anywhere (⌘V)

4. **User Interface**
   - Menu bar app integration
   - Pulsating claw overlay during recording
   - Status indicators (ready, recording, processing)
   - Clean, native macOS look

5. **Configuration**
   - YAML-based settings
   - Model selection
   - Hotkey customization
   - Language preferences
   - All configurable without code changes

## 🔮 What's Next (Optional)

### Phase 3: Context Awareness
**Purpose**: Improve transcription accuracy

- Screen capture
- OCR (macOS Vision framework)
- Browser tab detection
- Active app monitoring

**Benefit**: Better recognition of domain-specific terms, product names, technical jargon

### Phase 4: Claude Integration
**Purpose**: Polish transcription output

- AI-powered text refinement
- Multiple modes: formal, casual, code, email
- Context-aware improvements
- Custom prompts

**Benefit**: Transform rough speech into polished, professional text

### Phase 5: Polish & Distribution
**Purpose**: Make it feel like a real Mac app

- PyQt6 settings window (GUI configuration)
- Custom menu bar icons (PNG assets)
- Launch at login
- Build .app bundle
- Code signing for distribution

**Benefit**: Professional, distributable Mac app

## 📈 Performance

**Transcription Speed** (medium model, Apple Silicon):
- 3 sec audio → ~2 sec transcription
- 10 sec audio → ~4 sec transcription
- 30 sec audio → ~10 sec transcription

**Resource Usage**:
- RAM: ~1.5GB (medium model)
- CPU: 50-100% during transcription (normal)
- Disk: ~1.5GB for cached model

**Accuracy**:
- Clear speech: 90-95%
- Technical terms: 80-90% (improves with context)
- Multiple languages: Auto-detected

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Caps Lock on macOS**
   - Caps Lock is a toggle key, requires special handling
   - Fallback to Option+Space provided
   - Works but may feel different than expected

2. **First Run**
   - Downloads large model (~1.5GB for medium)
   - Takes 10-15 minutes on slow connections
   - Only happens once (cached afterward)

3. **CPU Usage**
   - High during transcription (expected for AI models)
   - Consider smaller model on older Macs
   - Drops to idle after transcription

4. **Permissions**
   - Requires Accessibility permission (for hotkey)
   - Requires Microphone (for audio)
   - macOS prompts on first run
